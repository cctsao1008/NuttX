	---help---
		If HAVE_CXX and HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE are slected, then this NSH
		example can be configured to initialize C++ constructors when it
		is started.  NSH does not use C++ and, by default, assumes that
		constructors are initialized elsewhere.  However, you can force
		NSH to initialize constructors by setting this option.
