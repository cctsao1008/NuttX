 * Name: sam_nand_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Create and initialize an raw NAND device instance.  This driver
 *   implements the RAW NAND interface:  No software ECC or sparing is
 *   performed here.  Those necessary NAND features are provided by common,
 *   higher level NAND MTD layers found in drivers/mtd.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   cs - Chip select number (in the event that multiple NAND devices
 *        are connected on-board).
 *
 * Returned value.
 *   On success a non-NULL pointer to an MTD device structure is returned;
 *   NULL is returned on a failure.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: board_nandflash_config
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_SAMA5_BOOT_CS3FLASH is defined, then NAND FLASH support is
 *   enabled.  This function provides the board-specific implementation of
 *   the logic to reprogram the SMC to support NAND FLASH on the specified
 *   CS.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   cs - Chip select number (in the event that multiple NAND devices
 *        are connected on-board).
 *
 * Returned Values:
 *   OK if the HSMC was successfully configured for this CS.  A negated
 *   errno value is returned on a failure.  This would fail with -ENODEV,
 *   for example, if the board does not support NAND FLASH on the requested
 *   CS.
