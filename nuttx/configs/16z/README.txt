ZDS-II Compiler Versions
========================

Version 5.0.1

  All testing has been performed with ZSD II verion 5.0.1 for the ZNEO.

Other Versions

  If you use any version of ZDS-II other than 5.0.1 or if you install ZDS-II
  at any location other than the default location, you will have to modify
  two files:  (1) configs/16z/*/setenv.sh and (2) configs/16z/*/Make.defs. 
  Simply edit these two files, changing 5.0.1 to whatever.

Patches
=======

A bug has been found in the ZDS-II toolchain version 5.0.1.  a patch is
available to work around the bug.  A summary of the nature the bug and
instructions for applying the patch follow.

Parameters are passed different to variadic functions (i.e., functions
that accept a varying number of parameters) than to regular functions.  For
most functions, parameters are passed in registers, beginning with R1.  But
for variadic functions, all parameters must be passed on the stack.

The logic works correctly for global functions, local functions, and most
function pointers.  It does not work correctly for the case where a variadic
function point is included within a structure.  In that case, the caller
inappropriately passes the parameters in registers; the receiver will
attempt to recover the parameters from the stack and a failure then follows.

This bug prevents the use of NSH with the ZNEO.  However, a patch has been
developed that works around the problem.  That patch can be found at
configs/16z/tools/zneo-zdsii-5_0_1-variadic-func-fix.patch.  In that
directory is also a bash script that will apply that patch for you.

The patch would be applied when NuttX is configured as follows:

  cd tools
  ./configure.sh 16z/nsh
  cd ..
  . ./setenv.sh
  dopath.sh $PWD
  make

See the section "Selecting Configurations" below.

Serial Console
==============

The 16z supports a single UART, UART0, that will be used to support the
NuttX serial console.

LEDs
====

The 16z board has 7 LEDs, five of which are controllable via software:

  ----- ------ ------ ------------------------------------
  LED   Color  Signal Description
  ----- ------ ------ ------------------------------------
  LED1  Red     3V3   Indicates the presence of +3.3V
  LED2  Red     5V    Indicates the presence of +5V

  LED3  Blue    ~RF   Controlled via PH2.  Notes: 1, 2
  LED4  Green   ~SXM  Controlled via PH3.  Notes: 1, 3
  LED5  Green   ~SD1  Controlled via PJ0.  Notes: 1, 4
  LED6  Yellow  ~SD2  Controlled via PJ4.  Notes: 1, 5
  LED7  Yellow  ~SD0  Controlled via PJ7.  Notes: 1, 6
  ----- ------ ------ ------------------------------------

  Note 1:  Pulled high so a low output illuminates the LED.
  Note 2:  PH2/~RF is also used by the RF transceiver, X2.  That part is not
           populated on my board.
  Note 3:  ~SXM is the chip select for the serial memory, U4.  That part is
           not populated on my board.
  Note 4:  ~SD1 is the chip select for the SD card 1, X11.
  Note 5:  ~SD2 is the chip select for the SD card 2, X10.
  Note 6:  ~SD0 is the chip select for the microSD 0, X12.

In conclusion:  None of the LEDs are available to indicate software status
without potentially sacrificing board functionality.  If the RF transceiver
is not installed (CONFIG_16Z_RFTRANSCEIVER=n) and if LED support is
requested (CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS), then LED3 will be used to indicate status:  A
solid color means that the board has boot successfully; flashing at a rate
of approximately 2Hz indicates a software failure.

RAM
===

The 16z has two IS66WVE4M16BLL 64Mb (4M x 16b) "Pseudo" SRAM parts on board.
This provides a total of 16MiB of SRAM from program usage.

Selecting Configurations
========================

Variations on the basic 16z configuration are maintained in subdirectories.
To configure any specific configuration, do the following steps:

   cd <nuttx-top-directory>/tools
   ./configure.sh 16z/<sub-directory>
   cd <nuttx-top-directory>
   make

Where <sub-directory> is the specific board configuration that you wish to
build.  The following board-specific configurations are available.  You may
also need to apply a path to NuttX before making.  Please refer the the
section "Patches" above"

Before entering the make command, make certain that the path to the ZNEO
compiler is in you PATH variable.  You make modify and use the setenv.sh
script to set that PATH if you like.  You can simply source setenv.sh
before making like:

  ...
  . ./setenv.sh
  make

Configuration Sub-directories
=============================

source/ and include/
--------------------

  These directories contain common logic for all 16z configurations.

nsh
---
  nsh:
    This configuration directory will built the NuttShell (NSH).  See
    the NSH user manual in the documents directory (or online at nuttx.org).
    See also the README.txt file in the nsh sub-directory for information
    about using ZDS-II.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          and misc/tools/

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration assumes that you are using the
       Cygwin environment on Windows.  An option is to use the native
       CMD.exe window build as described in the top-level README.txt
       file.  To set up that configuration:

       -CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
       +CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y

       And after configuring, make sure that CONFIG_APPS_DIR uses
       the back slash character.  For example:

        CONFIG_APPS_DIR="..\apps"

    3. By default, this configuration assumes that you are using the
       Cygwin environment on Windows.  An option is to use the native
       CMD.exe window build as described in the top-level README.txt
       file.  To set up that configuration:

       -CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
       +CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y

       And after configuring, make sure that CONFIG_APPS_DIR uses
       the back slash character.  For example:

        CONFIG_APPS_DIR="..\apps"

      NOTES:

      a. If you need to change the toolchain path used in Make.defs, you
         will need to use the short 8.3 filenames to avoid spaces.  On my
         PC, C:\PROGRA~1\ is is C:\Program Files\ and C:\PROGRA~2\ is
         C:\Program Files (x86)\
      b. You can't use setenv.sh in the native Windows environment.  Try
         scripts/setenv.bat instead.
      c. At present, the native Windows build fails at the final link stages.
         The failure is due to problems in arch/z16/src/nuttx.linkcmd that
         is autogenerated by arch/z16/src/Makefile.  The basic problem
         is the spurious spaces and and carrirage returns are generated at
         the end of the lines after a line continuation (\ ^M).  If these
         trailing bad characters are manually eliminated, then the build
         will succeed on the next try.

   STATUS:

     1. Note that you must apply the ZNEO patch if you are using ZDS-II 5.0.1.
        See the README.txt file in the parent directory for more information.

     2. This configuration does not run correctly.  There is currently a
        problem with the SRAM accesses.

Check out any README.txt files in these <sub-directory>s.
