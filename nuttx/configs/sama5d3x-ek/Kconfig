	---help---
		nor_main is a tiny program that runs in ISRAM.  nor_main will enable
		NOR flash then either (1) jump to the program in NOR flash or (2)
		wait for you to break in with GDB to debug the NOR program.

config SAMA5_NOR_START
	bool "Start NOR program"
	default n
	depends on SAMA5_NOR_MAIN
	---help---
		The default behavior of the NOR boot program is to initialize the
		NOR FLASH at CS0, then patiently wait for you to break into the
		program with GDB.  An alternative behvior is enabled with this
		option:  If SAMA5_NOR_START is defined, then it will not wait but
		will, instead, immediately start the program in NOR FLASH.

config SAMA5_AT25_AUTOMOUNT
	bool "AT25 auto-mount"

	depends on NSH_ARCHINIT && SAMA5_SPI0 && MTD_AT25

		Automatically initialize the AT25 SPI FLASH driver when NSH starts.

config SAMA5_AT25_FTL
	bool "Create AT25 block driver"
	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the AT25 and "wrap" the AT25 is a standard
		block driver that could then, for example, be mounted using FAT or
		any other file system.  Any file system may be used, but there will
		be no wear-leveling.

config SAMA5_AT25_NXFFS
	bool "Create AT25 NXFFS file system"
	depends on FS_NXFFS
	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the AT25 and and mount the AT25 device as
		a wear-leveling, NuttX FLASH file system (NXFFS).  The downside of
		NXFFS is that it can be very slow.
