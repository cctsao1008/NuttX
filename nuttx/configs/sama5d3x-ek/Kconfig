config SAMA5_NOR_MAIN
	bool "Build nor_main"
	default n
	depends on SAMA5_BOOT_ISRAM
	---help---
		nor_main is a tiny program that runs in ISRAM.  nor_main will enable
		NOR flash then either (1) jump to the program in NOR flash or (2)
		wait for you to break in with GDB to debug the NOR program.

config SAMA5_NOR_START
	bool "Start NOR program"
	default n
	depends on SAMA5_NOR_MAIN
	---help---
		The default behavior of the NOR boot program is to initialize the
		NOR FLASH at CS0, then patiently wait for you to break into the
		program with GDB.  An alternative behvior is enabled with this
		option:  If SAMA5_NOR_START is defined, then it will not wait but
		will, instead, immediately start the program in NOR FLASH.

config SAMA5_NAND_AUTOMOUNT
	bool "NAND FLASH auto-mount"
	default n
	depends on NSH_ARCHINIT && SAMA5_EBICS3_NAND
	---help---
		Automatically initialize the NAND FLASH driver when NSH starts.

config SAMA5_NAND_FTL
	bool "Create NAND FLASH block driver"
	depends on MTD && MTD_NAND
	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the NAND and "wrap" the NAND as a standard
		block driver that could then, for example, be mounted using FAT or
		any other file system.  Any file system may be used, but there will
		be no wear-leveling.

		NOTE: This options is not currently recommended.  There is not now
		NuttX file system that can handle the NAND back blocks or performs
		wear-leveling other than NXFFS and NXFFS does not use a block driver
		but, rather, operates directly upon the NAND MTD device.

config SAMA5_NAND_NXFFS
	bool "Create NAND FLASH NXFFS file system"
	depends on MTD && MTD_NAND && FS_NXFFS && NXFFS_NAND
	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the NAND and mount the NAND device as
		a wear-leveling, NuttX FLASH file system (NXFFS).  The downside of
		NXFFS is that it can be very slow.

		NOTE: NXFFS is recommended because (1) it can handle the NAND back
		blocks and (1) performs wear-leveling.

	depends on NSH_ARCHINIT && SAMA5_TWI0 && MTD_AT24XX
	---help---
		Automatically initialize the AT24 SPI EEPROM driver when NSH starts.

		The Serial EEPROM was mounted on an external adaptor board and
		connected to the SAMA5D3x-EK thusly:

		- VCC -- VCC
		- GND -- GND
		- TWCK0(PA31) -- SCL
		- TWD0(PA30)  -- SDA

		By default, PA30 and PA31 are SWJ-DP pins, it can be used as a pin
		for TWI peripheral in the end application.
